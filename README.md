# PickUpSticks

Pick up sticks is a simple casino game. The goal is to write a game that the end user cannot win. The user will input however many sticks they wish to play with. 
From there, either the user or the computer will pick up 1-3 sticks. The player who picks up the last stick loses. The program should then calculate a way to 
ensure it is always the winner. 

Tbh this is just a project to get me back on my feat and learn the syntax of C#. 

If for some reason, someone is looking at this, feel free to provide feedback. I'm new to programming and self taught.
